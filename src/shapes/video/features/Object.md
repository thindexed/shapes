## Object Detector

Object detection model that aims to localize and identify a object in a single 
image.

In the configuration dialog you can select one of 90 object types to detect.

This model detects objects defined in the **COCO** dataset, which is a large-scale 
object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. You can find more 
information [here](http://cocodataset.org/#home). The model is capable of 
detecting 90 classes of objects.
