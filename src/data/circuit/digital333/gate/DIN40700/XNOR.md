# XNOR Gate

## Description
The `XNOR gate` (pronounced as Exclusive NOR) is a digital logic gate 
whose function is the logical complement of the exclusive OR (XOR) 
gate[1]. The two-input version implements logical equality, behaving 
according to the truth table to the right, and hence the gate is 
sometimes called an "equivalence gate". A high output (1) results 
if both of the inputs to the gate are the same. If one but not both 
inputs are high (1), a low output (0) results.

| Low       | Low     |  `High`       |
| `High`      | Low     |  Low       |
| Low       | `High`    |  Low       |
