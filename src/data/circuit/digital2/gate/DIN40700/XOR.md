# XOR Gate

## Description
`XOR gate` (sometimes EOR, or EXOR and pronounced as Exclusive OR) is 
a digital logic gate that gives a true (1 or HIGH) output when the 
number of true inputs is odd. An XOR gate implements an exclusive 
or; that is, a true output results if one, and only one, of the 
inputs to the gate is true. If both inputs are false (0/LOW) or 
both are true, a false output results.
