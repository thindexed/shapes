The Roberts cross operator is used in image processing and computer vision 
for edge detection. It was one of the first edge detectors and was initially 
proposed by Lawrence Roberts in 1963.[1] As a differential operator, the idea 
behind the Roberts cross operator is to approximate the gradient of an image 
through discrete differentiation which is achieved by computing the sum of the 
squares of the differences between diagonally adjacent pixels.

According to Roberts, an edge detector should have the following properties: 
the produced edges should be well-defined, the background should contribute 
as little noise as possible, and the intensity of edges should correspond as 
close as possible to what a human would perceive.
