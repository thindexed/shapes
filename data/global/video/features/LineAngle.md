## Line Angle detector

Finds the most prominent Line in the Image and returns the angle of the line.

This is done by a "Hough Transformation"

You can test it on [https://freegroup.github.io/hough-transform-visualizer/](https://freegroup.github.io/hough-transform-visualizer/)
and inspect how the algorithm works.

Draw on the left area a line. You can see on the right the **Hough Transformation**.
Point with the mouse on one hospot. This is the location of a line on the left.
