# Delay Object

In electronics, digital circuits and digital electronics, the propagation 
delay, or gate delay, is the length of time which starts when the input to a 
logic gate becomes stable and valid to change, to the time that the output of 
that logic gate is stable and valid to change.

If you have some logic gates in chain, it is required to compensate the signal 
delay.

This is where the delay Object comes into play. It `delays` the input signal
to the given time delay.
